module: eos_validate_state_runner
version_added: "4.4.0"
author: Arista Ansible Team (@aristanetworks)
short_description: Leverage ANTA for eos_validate_state role
description:
  - The C(arista.avd.eos_validate_state_runner) module is an Ansible Action Plugin leveraging the ANTA test
    framework to validate that the generated structured configurations by AVD are applied to the devices and
    that the deployed network is working correctly.
  - This plugin expects that the structued_configs of each device is present in hostvars, otherwise no test will be generated.
  - |-
    The plugin provides the following capabilities:
        - Generate a per-device test catalog based on the structured_configs
        - Run the generated tests against each device and generate a report in Markdown and CSV format.
        - When using check_mode, only generate the test catalog and generate a report to preview what would tests be run against each device
        - Dumping the per-device catalog to a file.
        - Backward compatibility with existing ansible tags behavior for eos_validate_state to filter categories of tests.
